# Crowdfunding pattern analysis in Excel
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to organize and analyze a sample database of crowdfunding campaigns in order to discover trends in campaign success or failure. The analysis makes use of VLOOKUPS and Pivot Tables in order to analyze the data more succinctly. 
### Results
The analysis shows several distinct trends.

The Goals analysis tells us that campaigns whose goals are at the bottom and top end of the spectrum are more likely to fail, whereas mid-range goals are the most likely to succeed.

The Category analysis shows that the largest number of campaigns, both successful and not, are launched in the theatre category; and that the greatest number of successful campaigns come from this same category. So even though there is lots of competition, campaigns categorized as theatrical are still very likely to get funded.

The Statistical analysis shows that backer number is not the only predictor for the success of a campaign. With a lower goal amount, a small number of backers can cause a campaign to be successful; whereas thousands of backers may still leave a campaign unsuccessful if the goal amount was very high.

## Summary
The results indicate that having a moderate campaign goal and finding backers willing to contribute a large amount are both good strategies for ensuring campaign success. They also indicate that understanding consumer trends, in this case the increased willingness of backers to support theatrical campaigns, will help organizers launch successful campaigns.
